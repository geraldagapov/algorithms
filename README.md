# algorithms
Algorithms implementations for sport programming.

Use template.cpp as a template for implementation.
Place your code between two lines with comments
"\_\_IMPLEMENTATION\_START\_\_" and "\_\_IMPLEMENTATION\_END\_\_".

In future I plan to write a vim plugin that will take
an implementation and inline it into your code.
